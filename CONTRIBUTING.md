# Contributing

## Branch Strategy

- Default branch is `main`.
- Do not push directly to `main`.
- Use branch prefixes: `feat/*`, `fix/*`, `chore/*`, `docs/*`.

## Commit Style

- Use Conventional Commits.
- Keep commit subject concise and action-oriented.

## Pull Requests

1. Rebase or merge latest `main`.
2. Explain changes, test results, and known risks.
3. Require at least one approval before merge.
4. Merge after required checks pass.

## Security

- Remove credentials from examples and screenshots.
- Keep sensitive data out of commits and issues.
